# Amend Constitution Phase 3

## Prompt
```
Create constitution.phase3.md that:
•    Preserves Phase I & II architecture unchanged
•    Adds AI Chatbot as isolated feature module
•    No breaking DB changes (only additive migrations)
•    Stateless backend only
•    All state persisted in Neon DB
•    JWT auth unchanged
•    Vercel-safe deployment
•    Spec-first, no manual edits outside SDD flow
```

## Response
```
I've updated the constitution to reflect Phase III requirements while preserving the existing architecture. The new constitution includes:

- Updated core principles to emphasize preservation of Phase I & II architecture
- Added AI Chatbot Isolated Feature Module principle
- Added No Breaking Database Changes (Additive Only) principle
- Added Statelessness with Persistent Storage principle
- Added Vercel-Safe Deployment principle
- Maintained all existing principles including JWT authentication unchanged
- Updated version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 with minor version bump for new principles
- Created sync impact report documenting all changes

The constitution now reflects the requirements for Phase III AI Chatbot integration while ensuring all existing functionality remains intact.
