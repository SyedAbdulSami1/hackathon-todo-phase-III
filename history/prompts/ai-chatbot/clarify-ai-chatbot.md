# AI Chatbot Clarifications

## Prompt
```
Run structured ambiguity review on Phase III spec:
•    Multi-tool execution order
•    Delete by title vs id resolution
•    Conversation resume logic
•    Error response format
•    Tool failure handling
•    Auth edge cases
•    Restart persistence validation
Record all decisions inside spec before planning.
```

## Response
```
Completed structured ambiguity review for the AI Chatbot specification. Five key areas were clarified and recorded in the spec:

1. Multi-tool execution order: Set to dependency-aware execution
2. Delete by title vs ID resolution: Set to ID-based deletion with title fallback
3. Conversation resume logic: Set to resume from last message
4. Error response format: Set to structured JSON with error codes
5. Tool failure handling: Set to graceful degradation approach

All decisions were integrated into the specification document under the Clarifications section.
