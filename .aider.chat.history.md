#### Type error: Import declaration conflicts with local declaration of 'Filter'.  

To resolve the import conflict with the local declaration of `Filter`, we need to rename either the import or the local declaration. Let's rename the import to avoid the conflict.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for `frontend\components\filter.tsx`:

frontend\components\filter.tsx
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Filter } from "@/components/ui/filter"
=======
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Filter as FilterComponent } from "@/components/ui/filter"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to update any usage of the `Filter` import in the same file to use `FilterComponent` instead.

frontend\components\filter.tsx
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            <Filter
              key={option.value}
              variant={status === option.value ? 'default' : 'outline'}
              size="sm"
              onClick={() => onStatusChange(option.value)}
=======
            <FilterComponent
              key

####   3 | import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'  

Got it. Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to rename the import of `Filter` to `FilterComponent` in `frontend\components\filter.tsx`:

frontend\components\filter.tsx
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Filter } from "@/components/ui/filter"
=======
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Filter as FilterComponent } from "@/components/ui/filter"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to update any usage of the `Filter` import in the same file to use `FilterComponent` instead.

frontend\components\filter.tsx
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            <Filter
              key={option.value}
              variant={status === option.value ? 'default' : 'outline'}
              size="sm"
              onClick={() => onStatusChange(option.value)}
=======
            <FilterComponent
              key={option.value}
              variant={status === option.value ? 'default' : 'outline'}
              size="sm"
              onClick={() => onStatusChange(option.value)}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should resolve the import conflict.
